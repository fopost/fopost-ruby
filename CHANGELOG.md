## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-30

Initial release.

- `Fopost::Client` with `posts`, `accounts`, `workspaces`, `labels`, and `ai` resources.
- Automatic retry on `429`, honouring `Retry-After`.
- Typed error classes per status, all rescuable as `Fopost::Error`.
- Response models that accept either wire casing and keep unknown fields on `#raw`.
- A pluggable transport, so the HTTP stack can be swapped or stubbed.
